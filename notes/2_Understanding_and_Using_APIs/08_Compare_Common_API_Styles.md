# Compare Common API Styles

## REST

- Not a protocol
- Guidelines for the structure and organization of an API
- Can use JSON, XML, Markdown, CSV, etc
- Use querystrings or the request body for API calls
- Postman is the recommended REST agent for exploring APIs

## SOAP

- Is a protocol with specifications at various layers
- More overhead, but more comprehensive
- ONLY uses XML
- Requires a verbose XML document for API calls
- Payload similar to RPCs
```
<getUser>
  <name>Jogn Snith</name>
</getUser>
```
- SoapUI is the recommended SOAP agent for exploring APIs

## RPC
