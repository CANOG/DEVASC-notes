# Describe the Benefits of Edge Computing

- Move data processing and storage closer to where it is collected and used

- Pros
  - Speed (reduced latency)
  - Privacy (push data processing closer to user leaves data in fewer places)
  - Resilliency (distributing means less impact due to e.g. a DDoS or site going down)
  - Scalability (scale out)
  - Versitility (expand into new markets without expanding infrastructure)
- Cons
  - Resource requirements (pushing processing out to end-devices may require more power than e.g. a phone has)
  - Infrastructure complexity (more moving pieces)
  - Distribution of security (physical access in colo facilities, etc)
