# Identify the Attributes of Application Deployment Types

### Deployment Types

##### Bare Metal

- Traditional dedicated hardware deployment

#### Virtual Machines

- One or more child compute nodes share parent node hardware
- Each VM runs its own OS/kernel

#### Containers

- One or more child compute namespaces share parent node hardware
- Each container shares the OS/kernel of its parent, making them more lightweight than VMs
