# Utilize BASH Commands

## File Management

- `cp` copy files
- `mv` move files
- `ln` create a link (i.e. shortcut)

## Directory Navigation

- `cd` change directory
- `pwd` display current working directory

#### Directory shorthand

`.` current directory
`..` parent directory
`~` current user's home directory

File paths that start with a slash (`/`) are absolute - they start from the root of the file system
File paths that do not start with a slash are relative - they depend on the current working directory

## Environment Variables

Variables stored within the OS itself (not specific to Linux or BASH)
