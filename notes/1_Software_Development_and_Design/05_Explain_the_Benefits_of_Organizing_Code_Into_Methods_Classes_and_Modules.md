# Explain the Benefits of Organizing Code Into Methods/Functinos, Classes, and Modules

DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself

## Methods/Functions

### Functions

- Allow for a block of code to be "assigned to' a symbol and invoked on-demand
- Does not run until invoked
- Can be invoked as many times as needed

### Methods

- Functions defined as part of a class
- Reference the object instance they're being invoked from (i.e. `self`)

## Classes

- Maintainable
- Debuggable
- Testable
- Legible

## Modules
